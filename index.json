This fact implies the need for resources to evaluate these models. In the case of Spanish, there are few ways to systematically assess the models' quality. In this paper, we narrow the gap by building two evaluation benchmarks. Inspired by previous work (Conneau and Kiela, 2018; Chen et al., 2019), we introduce Spanish SentEval and Spanish DiscoEval, aiming to assess the capabilities of stand-alone and discourse-aware sentence representations, respectively. Our benchmarks include considerable pre-existing and newly constructed datasets that address different tasks from various domains. In addition, we evaluate and analyze the most recent pre-trained Spanish language models to exhibit their capabilities and limitations. As an example, we discover that for the case of discourse evaluation tasks, mBERT, a language model trained on multiple languages, usually provides a richer latent representation than models trained only with documents in Spanish. We hope our contribution will motivate a fairer, more comparable, and less cumbersome way to evaluate future Spanish language models.","tags":["evaluation","spanish","dataset","benchmark","language model","nlp"],"title":"Evaluation Benchmarks for Spanish Sentence Representations","type":"benchmarks"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Congratulations to Jian Yang and Monica Hall for winning the Best Paper Award at the 2020 Conference on Wowchemy for their paper “Learning Wowchemy”.\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
